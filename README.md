# 👋 Hi, I'm Adam Wright

I’m the Product Manager for EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD). Most of my days are filled with the classic Product Management staples like roadmap development and backlog grooming.

But the part I love most is definitely connecting with customers. Whether I'm chatting with ISVs about embedding our tech to enable their own software, running live demos, or turning customer wishlists into actual features, I'm all about making a true distributed system work on top of actual PostgreSQL. 

## 🚀 Where I've been

Before I working on Distributed Systems with PGD, I spent my time across a few different corners of the Postgres ecosystem:

* **EDB Database Servesr:** I helped steer EDB’s contributions to open-source PostgreSQL and managed enhancements for our commercial distributions.
* **Cloud Native & Kubernetes:** I was part of the early crew bringing Postgres to containers and K8s, including some of the initial work that eventually became the **CloudNativePG** project.
* **Professional Services:** Back in the day, I worked in the field getting my hands dirty doing migrations from Oracle to Postgres.
