# 👋 Hi, I'm Adam Wright

I’m the Product Manager for EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD). Most of my days are filled with the classic Product Management staples like roadmap development and backlog grooming.

But the part I love most is definitely connecting with customers. Whether I'm chatting with ISVs about embedding our tech to enable their own software, running live demos, or turning customer wishlists into actual features, I'm all about making a true distributed system work on top of actual PostgreSQL. 

## 🚀 Where I've been

Before working on Distributed Systems with PGD, I spent my time across a few different corners of the Postgres ecosystem:

* **EDB Database Servesr:** I helped steer EDB’s contributions to open-source PostgreSQL and managed enhancements for our commercial distributions.
* **Cloud Native & Kubernetes:** I was part of the early crew bringing Postgres to containers and K8s, including some of the initial work that eventually became the **CloudNativePG** project.
* **Professional Services:** Back in the day, I worked in the field getting my hands dirty doing migrations from Oracle to Postgres.

## 👀 Tech Interests 

* **Daily Driving KDE:** I’m a big fan of the KDE desktop environment.
* **K8s & Databases:** I enjoy building and running containerized systems, specifically when there’s a database involved.
* **Security & Observability:** Huge fan of using **osquery** to keep an eye on what’s actually happening under the hood.
* **AI Workflows:** Like everyone else lately, I spend a fair amount of time both weaving AI into my daily routine and poking at where it actually belongs inside the products I manage.
